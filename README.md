# Laser Juke Explorer
Application designed for my own personal use for collection [Laser Juke](https://forum.lddb.com/viewtopic.php?f=22&t=225) laserdiscs.


Laser Juke titles sourced from [Tino Rochler's Alle Laser Juke Disc Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1_k4GNC842r9RLUN2l3n50vRKuRUhfxBdSu0rVdYQmVw). I intend on adding this information to https://www.lddb.com/ eventually.
